There are two functions written in this
i) makeCacheMatrix

This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

ii) cacheSolve
This function computes the inverse of the matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
then cacheSolve will retrieve the inverse from the cache
